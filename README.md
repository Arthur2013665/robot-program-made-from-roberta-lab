Hello! I made this program for educational purposes for kids to learn programming robots but simpler. If the student wants to use this file on OpenRobertaLab app online on the internet they need to select to import the NEPO program and they need the xml file. If the led commands doesnt save put at red and green and blue and green combinations led 1, led 2. and at the led almost rainbow color combination to put the led from 1 to 5 and at the command to wait 5000 ms put at, next, block turn off all led.This program is made exclusively for m2Bot model so dont try using it on another model of robots just if you make the code here for another bot.Thank you for choosing this program!!!
